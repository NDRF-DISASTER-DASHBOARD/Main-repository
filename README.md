**Welcome to the Disaster Management Software Repository!**

This software is designed to work with government agencies, such as National Disaster Relief Forces (NDRF) and State Disaster Relief Forces (SDRF), to help them manage disasters more effectively. Our software uses advanced technologies to search for disaster-related images and live details from social media, news articles, and the web, and generates a comprehensive report that is sent to the concerned agency.

**Key Features:**

* **Image Search**: Our software uses AI-powered image recognition to search for disaster-related images on social media and the web.
* **Live Details**: We collect live details from social media, news articles, and the web to provide real-time information on disasters.
* **Report Generation**: Our software generates a comprehensive report based on the collected data, which is sent to the concerned agency.
* **Agency Integration**: We work closely with government agencies to ensure seamless integration of our software with their existing systems.

**How it Works:**

1. Our software uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to search for disaster-related keywords on social media and the web.
2. We collect and analyze data from various sources, including news articles, social media posts, and images.
3. Our software generates a comprehensive report based on the collected data, which includes details on the disaster, affected areas, and response efforts.
4. The report is sent to the concerned agency, which can then use the information to respond to the disaster more effectively.

**Design:**

We have designed our software to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Our design is based on the principles of human-centered design, and we have conducted extensive user research to ensure that our software meets the needs of our users.
